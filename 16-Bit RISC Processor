# 16-Bit RISC Processor

## Overview
This project implements a **16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Processor** using Verilog HDL. The processor includes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and Register File to perform basic arithmetic, logical, and control operations.

## Features
- **16-bit data path**
- **ALU**: Supports basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and manages processor states.
- **Register File**: Includes general-purpose registers for data storage.
- **Testbench**: Verifies functionality through simulation.
