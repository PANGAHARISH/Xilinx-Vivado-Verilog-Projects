# 16-Bit RISC Processor

## Overview
This project implements a 16-bit RISC Processor using Verilog HDL. The processor performs basic arithmetic, logical, and control operations.

## Features
- 16-bit data path
- ALU, Control Unit, and Register File
- Testbench for verification

## File Structure
- **src/**: Contains Verilog source files.
- **tb/**: Testbench for simulation.
- **constraints/**: Xilinx constraints file.
- **sim/**: Simulation waveforms and logs.

## How to Run
1. Open Xilinx Vivado.
2. Import the source files and constraints.
3. Run synthesis, implementation, and simulation.

## Simulation Results
